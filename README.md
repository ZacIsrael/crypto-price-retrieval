This application uses the Blockchain API to check the price of a cryptocurrency for end user. This idea was inspired by Dr. Angela Yu.

In this project, I am expected to build a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates the blockchain API. My finished site should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.
